## Description :

This is a MERN stack book search engine and as the name suggests it uses MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js it also uses the graphQL instead of the more traditional RESTful API to query from the MongoDB. GraphQL is a lot simpler to set up than the RESTful APIs due to the lack of need for setup a route for each query and in RESTful API you need to setup a GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH GraphQL gets a way with only post queries but of course each has its advantages and disadvantages. All of the information saved to a MongoDB atlas database and the Authorization of this webapp handled with JWT json web tokens.
